  abstract = {Mobile hydrogen, when dissolving in metals, redistributes due to the density gradients and elastic stresses, and enables destruction processes or phase transformations in local volumes of a solvent metal. It is rather important in solid state physics to investigate these interactions. The first-principle calculations performed in terms of the density functional theory, are used for thermodynamic simulation of the elastic stress effect on the energy of hydrogen dissolution in $\alpha$-Fe crystal lattice. The paper presents investigations of the total energy of Fe--H system depending on the lattice parameter. As a result, the relation is obtained between the hydrogen dissolution energy and stress. A good agreement is shown between the existing data and simulation results. The extended equation is suggested for the chemical potential of hydrogen atom in iron within the local stress field. Two parameters affecting the hydrogen distribution are compared, namely local stress and phase transformations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerous experimental studies have shown that the formulation of a quality AlxIn1-xN crystal is undeniably challenging, due to mismatch of certain physical properties between its parent blocks. Prior knowledge regarding proper mixture of aluminium and indium could be helpful in the blending of this crystal. Here, by applying ab initio crossbreed evolutionary computations, extensive search for the thermodynamically and practically stable composites of AlNInN was performed. Set at atmospheric pressure, the comprehensive calculations brought forth a thermodynamically stable structure Al4In2N6 (Cmc21) along with five metastable compounds in AlIn7N8 (P3m1), Al5InN6 (P31m), Al2In4N6 (Cc/Aa), Al3In3N6 (Cm/Am) and Al6In2N8 (P21). Electronic structure calculations within Density Functional Theory and Bader charge analysis are also discussed. All structures are revealed to be mixed bonding direct semiconductor with \{GW\} corrected gap in the range of 0.5‚Äì6.0¬†eV. },
