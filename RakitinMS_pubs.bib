  abstract = {The Inner Shell Spectroscopy (ISS) beamline on the 8-ID station at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), Upton, NY, USA, is a high-throughput X-ray absorption spectroscopy beamline designed for in situ, operando, and time-resolved material characterization using high monochromatic flux and scanning speed. This contribution discusses the technical specifications of the beamline in terms of optics, heat load management, monochromator motion control, and data acquisition and processing. Results of the beamline tests demonstrating the quality of the data obtainable on the instrument, possible energy scanning speeds, as well as long-term beamline stability are shown. The ability to directly control the monochromator trajectory to define the acquisition time for each spectral region is highlighted. Examples of studies performed on the beamline are presented. The paper is concluded with a brief outlook for future developments.},

  abstract = {Insertion devices have become the dominant photon source at synchrotron and free electron laser light source facilities the world over. Undulators, characterized by their small deflection parameter, exhibit a high degree of constructive interference in photon production from high energy charged particle beams leading to very high photon rates at specific harmonics of the fundamental frequency with relatively narrow spectral widths. Spectroscopic measurements of interest typically span several of these harmonic widths, which requires precision adjustment of an undulator’s magnetic gap to maintain peak flux within the much narrower bandwidth of a beamline monochromator at the desired energy. High precision insertion device controls are developed at NSLS-II including real-time linked control of monochromator hardware allowing for fast, high precision, hardware triggered, spectroscopic measurements. This fast fly scan method is described, compared statistically for self consistency, and shown to be far superior in both efficiency and accuracy as compared to standard step scan measurements.},

  abstract = {Synchrotron X-ray footprinting (XF) is a growing structural biology technique that leverages radiation-induced chemical modifications via X-ray radiolysis of water to produce hydroxyl radicals that probe changes in macromolecular structure and dynamics in solution states of interest. The X-ray Footprinting of Biological Materials (XFP) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II provides the structural biology community with access to instrumentation and expert support in the XF method, and is also a platform for development of new technological capabilities in this field. The design and implementation of a new high-throughput endstation device based around use of a 96-well PCR plate form factor and supporting diagnostic instrumentation for synchrotron XF is~described. This development enables a pipeline for rapid comprehensive screening of the influence of sample chemistry on hydroxyl radical dose using a convenient fluorescent assay, illustrated here with a study of 26 organic compounds. The new high-throughput endstation device and sample evaluation pipeline now available at the XFP beamline provide the worldwide structural biology community with a robust resource for carrying out well optimized synchrotron XF studies of challenging biological systems with complex sample~compositions.},

At the Life Science X-ray Scattering (LiX) beamline, new instrumentation and mail-in protocols have been developed to remove the access barrier to solution scattering measurements. Our efforts took advantage of existing instrumentation and coincided with the larger effort at NSLS-II to support remote measurements. Given the limited staff{--}user interaction for mail-in measurements, additional software tools have been developed to ensure data quality, to automate the adjustments in data processing, as users would otherwise rely on the experience of the beamline staff, and produce a summary of the initial assessments of the data. This report describes the details of these developments.},

It is rather important in solid state physics to investigate these interactions. The first-principle calculations performed in terms of the density functional theory, are used for thermodynamic simulation of the elastic stress effect on the energy of hydrogen dissolution in $\alpha$-Fe crystal lattice. The paper presents investigations of the total energy of Fe--H system depending on the lattice parameter. As a result, the relation is obtained between the hydrogen dissolution energy and stress. A good agreement is shown between the existing data and simulation results. The extended equation is suggested for the chemical potential of hydrogen atom in iron within the local stress field. Two parameters affecting the hydrogen distribution are compared, namely local stress and phase transformations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerous experimental studies have shown that the formulation of a quality AlxIn1-xN crystal is undeniably challenging, due to mismatch of certain physical properties between its parent blocks. Prior knowledge regarding proper mixture of aluminium and indium could be helpful in the blending of this crystal. Here, by applying ab initio crossbreed evolutionary computations, extensive search for the thermodynamically and practically stable composites of AlNInN was performed. Set at atmospheric pressure, the comprehensive calculations brought forth a thermodynamically stable structure Al4In2N6 (Cmc21) along with five metastable compounds in AlIn7N8 (P3m1), Al5InN6 (P31m), Al2In4N6 (Cc/Aa), Al3In3N6 (Cm/Am) and Al6In2N8 (P21). Electronic structure calculations within Density Functional Theory and Bader charge analysis are also discussed. All structures are revealed to be mixed bonding direct semiconductor with \{GW\} corrected gap in the range of 0.5–6.0 eV.},
