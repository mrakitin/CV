  abstract  = {With the motivation of searching for new superconductors in the Mg-B system{,} we performed ab initio evolutionary searches for all the stable compounds in this binary system in the pressure range of 0-200 GPa. We found previously unknown{,} yet thermodynamically stable{,} compositions MgB3 and Mg3B10. Experimentally known MgB2 is stable in the entire pressure range 0-200 GPa{,} while MgB7 and MgB12 are stable at pressures below 90 GPa and 35 GPa{,} respectively. We predict a reentrant behavior for MgB4{,} which becomes unstable against decomposition into MgB2 and MgB7 at 4 GPa and then becomes stable above 61 GPa. We find ubiquity of phases with boron sandwich structures analogous to the AlB2-type structure. However{,} with the exception of MgB2{,} all other magnesium borides have low electron-phonon coupling constants [small lambda] of 0.32-0.39 and are predicted to have Tc below 3 K.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerous experimental studies have shown that the formulation of a quality AlxIn1-xN crystal is undeniably challenging, due to mismatch of certain physical properties between its parent blocks. Prior knowledge regarding proper mixture of aluminium and indium could be helpful in the blending of this crystal. Here, by applying ab initio crossbreed evolutionary computations, extensive search for the thermodynamically and practically stable composites of AlNInN was performed. Set at atmospheric pressure, the comprehensive calculations brought forth a thermodynamically stable structure Al4In2N6 (Cmc21) along with five metastable compounds in AlIn7N8 (P3m1), Al5InN6 (P31m), Al2In4N6 (Cc/Aa), Al3In3N6 (Cm/Am) and Al6In2N8 (P21). Electronic structure calculations within Density Functional Theory and Bader charge analysis are also discussed. All structures are revealed to be mixed bonding direct semiconductor with \{GW\} corrected gap in the range of 0.5–6.0 eV. },
