  abstract = {Autonomous methods to align beamlines can decrease the amount of time spent on diagnostics, and also uncover better global optima leading to better beam quality. The alignment of these beamlines is a high-dimensional expensive-to-sample optimization problem involving the simultaneous treatment of many optical elements with correlated and nonlinear dynamics. Bayesian optimization is a strategy of efficient global optimization that has proved successful in similar regimes in a wide variety of beamline alignment applications, though it has typically been implemented for particular beamlines and optimization tasks. In this paper, we present a basic formulation of Bayesian inference and Gaussian process models as they relate to multi-objective Bayesian optimization, as well as the practical challenges presented by beamline alignment. We show that the same general implementation of Bayesian optimization with special consideration for beamline alignment can quickly learn the dynamics of particular beamlines in an online fashion through hyperparameter fitting with no prior information. We present the implementation of a concise software framework for beamline alignment and test it on four different optimization problems for experiments on X-ray beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source II and the Advanced Light Source, and an electron beam at the Accelerator Test Facility, along with benchmarking on a simulated digital twin. We discuss new applications of the framework, and the potential for a unified approach to beamline alignment at synchrotron facilities.},

Further, such simulations also help to develop and test experimental data processing methods and software in advance. The {\it Synchrotron Radiation Workshop} ({\it SRW}) software package supports such complex simulations. We demonstrate how recent developments in {\it SRW} significantly improve the efficiency of physical optics simulations, such as end-to-end simulations of time-dependent X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy experiments with partially coherent undulator radiation (UR). The molecular dynamics simulation code {\it LAMMPS} was chosen to model the sample: a solution of silica nanoparticles in water at room temperature. Real-space distributions of nanoparticles produced by {\it LAMMPS} were imported into {\it SRW} and used to simulate scattering patterns of partially coherent hard X-ray UR from such a sample at the detector. The partially coherent UR illuminating the sample can be represented by a set of orthogonal coherent modes obtained by simulation of emission and propagation of this radiation through the coherent hard X-ray (CHX) scattering beamline followed by a coherent-mode decomposition. GPU acceleration is added for several key functions of {\it SRW} used in propagation from sample to detector, further improving the speed of the calculations. The accuracy of this simulation is benchmarked by comparison with experimental data.},

Bluesky provides high level abstraction of experimental procedures and instrument readouts to encapsulate generic workflows. We present a prototype data analysis platform for integrating data collection with real time analysis at the beamline.

Precise alignment of the beamline optics is required to achieve adequate beam properties at the sample. This process is often done manually and can be quite time consuming. Further, we would like to know the properties at the sample in order to provide metadata for X-ray experiments. Diagnostics may provide some of this information but important properties may remain unmeasured. In order to solve both of these problems, we are developing tools to create fast online models (also known as digital twins). For this purpose, we are creating reduced models that fit into a hierarchy of X-ray models of varying degrees of complexity and runtime. These are implemented within a software framework called Sirepo-Bluesky that allows for the computation of the model from within a Bluesky session which may control a real beamline. This work is done in collaboration with NSLS-II. We present the status of the software development and beamline measurements including results from the TES beamline. Finally, we present an outlook for continuing this work and applying it to more beamlines at NSLS-II and other synchrotron facilities around the world.}},

  abstract  = {The NSLS-II network and computing infrastructure has been significantly updated recently. The re-IP process in 2020-2021 enabled the NSLS-II network to be routable to the rest of the BNL campus. Then, standardization of the operating systems and deployment procedures helped to deliver a consistent environment to workstations and servers used by all NSLS-II beamlines. In particular, the RedHat Enterprise Linux 8 was deployed to 700+ machines using the RedHat Satellite infrastructure management product, and all critical services (IOCs, databases, etc.) were migrated to the new OS. NFS usersâ€™ home directories are consistent across all of the machines, which eliminates the need for the individual configuration of the user environment on each host. The standard suite of software packages is available to the beamline staff and users, which includes the system packages (deployed via RPM) as well as the conda environments for data acquisition and analysis. Security measures were implemented to comply with the industry standards, which include multi-factor authentication (using Duo), secure screen lock for the beamline machines, and advanced access control to the experimental data that is stored in shared central storage available on all hosts. These major enhancements facilitated sharing the experimental data (currently for a number of selected beamlines, with a plan to extend it to the whole facility in the nearest future) with the users via an externally facing JupyterHub instance - https://jupyter.nsls2.bnl.gov. The beamlines keep using the Bluesky data acquisition framework to orchestrate their experiments, and the new infrastructure enabled them to use a next-generation data access library called tiled.},

Practical operations involve frequent variation in beamline component positions and orientation, particularly when photon beam parameters shift due to experimental needs, or due to variations in the incoming photon beam. The alignment process can be time consuming and takes away from valuable beam time for experimental data collection. We describe progress in the automation of certain alignment tasks on the tender-energy X-ray spectroscopy (TES) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). The beamline is controlled using the BlueSky software in which high level experimental plans guide the beamline components during an experiment. Numerous software packages exist for beamline modeling, and they may be tied to the beamline control system using a package we are continuing to develop called Sirepo-Bluesky. The photon beam distribution may be measured with fluorescent screens, and a relation between beam and machine state can be found by varying the mirror and aperture settings over a multi-dimensional range. We describe the results of such parameter varying measurements and how we are combining Sirepo-Bluesky with machine learning methods and reduced models to automate mirror alignment on the TES beamline.},

  abstract = {The Inner Shell Spectroscopy (ISS) beamline on the 8-ID station at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), Upton, NY, USA, is a high-throughput X-ray absorption spectroscopy beamline designed for in situ, operando, and time-resolved material characterization using high monochromatic flux and scanning speed. This contribution discusses the technical specifications of the beamline in terms of optics, heat load management, monochromator motion control, and data acquisition and processing. Results of the beamline tests demonstrating the quality of the data obtainable on the instrument, possible energy scanning speeds, as well as long-term beamline stability are shown. The ability to directly control the monochromator trajectory to define the acquisition time for each spectral region is highlighted. Examples of studies performed on the beamline are presented. The paper is concluded with a brief outlook for future developments.},

  abstract = {Insertion devices have become the dominant photon source at synchrotron and free electron laser light source facilities the world over. Undulators, characterized by their small deflection parameter, exhibit a high degree of constructive interference in photon production from high energy charged particle beams leading to very high photon rates at specific harmonics of the fundamental frequency with relatively narrow spectral widths. Spectroscopic measurements of interest typically span several of these harmonic widths, which requires precision adjustment of an undulatorâ€™s magnetic gap to maintain peak flux within the much narrower bandwidth of a beamline monochromator at the desired energy. High precision insertion device controls are developed at NSLS-II including real-time linked control of monochromator hardware allowing for fast, high precision, hardware triggered, spectroscopic measurements. This fast fly scan method is described, compared statistically for self consistency, and shown to be far superior in both efficiency and accuracy as compared to standard step scan measurements.},

Recent efforts to address these needs at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) have resulted in the creation of the Bluesky data collection framework*, an open-source library providing for experimental control and scientific data collection via high level abstraction of experimental procedures, instrument readouts, and data analysis. We present a prototype data management interface that couples with Bluesky to support guided simulation, measurement, and rapid processing operations. Initial demonstrations illustrate application to coherent X-ray scattering beamlines at the NSLS-II. We then discuss extensions of this interface to permit analysis operations across distributed computing resources, including the use of the Sirepo scientific framework, as well as Jupyter notebooks running on remote computing clusters**.}},

The X-ray Footprinting of Biological Materials (XFP) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II provides the structural biology community with access to instrumentation and expert support in the XF method, and is also a platform for development of new technological capabilities in this field. The design and implementation of a new high-throughput endstation device based around use of a 96-well PCR plate form factor and supporting diagnostic instrumentation for synchrotron XF is~described. This development enables a pipeline for rapid comprehensive screening of the influence of sample chemistry on hydroxyl radical dose using a convenient fluorescent assay, illustrated here with a study of 26 organic compounds. The new high-throughput endstation device and sample evaluation pipeline now available at the XFP beamline provide the worldwide structural biology community with a robust resource for carrying out well optimized synchrotron XF studies of challenging biological systems with complex sample~compositions.},

Our efforts took advantage of existing instrumentation and coincided with the larger effort at NSLS-II to support remote measurements.

  abstract = {Mobile hydrogen, when dissolving in metals, redistributes due to the density gradients and elastic stresses, and enables destruction processes or phase transformations in local volumes of a solvent metal. It is rather important in solid state physics to investigate these interactions. The first-principle calculations performed in terms of the density functional theory, are used for thermodynamic simulation of the elastic stress effect on the energy of hydrogen dissolution in $\alpha$-Fe crystal lattice. The paper presents investigations of the total energy of Fe--H system depending on the lattice parameter. As a result, the relation is obtained between the hydrogen dissolution energy and stress. A good agreement is shown between the existing data and simulation results. The extended equation is suggested for the chemical potential of hydrogen atom in iron within the local stress field. Two parameters affecting the hydrogen distribution are compared, namely local stress and phase transformations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerous experimental studies have shown that the formulation of a quality AlxIn1-xN crystal is undeniably challenging, due to mismatch of certain physical properties between its parent blocks. Prior knowledge regarding proper mixture of aluminium and indium could be helpful in the blending of this crystal. Here, by applying ab initio crossbreed evolutionary computations, extensive search for the thermodynamically and practically stable composites of AlNInN was performed. Set at atmospheric pressure, the comprehensive calculations brought forth a thermodynamically stable structure Al4In2N6 (Cmc21) along with five metastable compounds in AlIn7N8 (P3m1), Al5InN6 (P31m), Al2In4N6 (Cc/Aa), Al3In3N6 (Cm/Am) and Al6In2N8 (P21). Electronic structure calculations within Density Functional Theory and Bader charge analysis are also discussed. All structures are revealed to be mixed bonding direct semiconductor with \{GW\} corrected gap in the range of 0.5â€“6.0Â eV.},
